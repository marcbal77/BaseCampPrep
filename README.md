# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with:

1. A sample contract
2. A test for that contract
3. And a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts

One can run the command: 
npx hardhat
within the root of the project to get a list of all the commands and options that are available.
```

Remember that Solidity is a compiled language that let's one write human readable code that translates into bit code for the blockchain.

Note: there is a console log for hardhat that is great for useful for testing.
