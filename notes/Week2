Be able to:
	- Describe the difference between conditional control structures and iteration control structures
	- Write conditional control structures: if, else if, else
	- List the unique constraints for control flow structures in Solidity

================================================

- [ ] Loops (Video: 8:58)

Link: https://docs.base.org/base-camp/docs/control-structures/loops-vid 

Be able to:
	- Use iteration control structures: for, break and continue to control the flow of your smart contracts

Loops are useful to repeat certain pieces of code until certain conditions are met
